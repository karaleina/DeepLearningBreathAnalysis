This is research project examinating possibility of analysing breath with DL algorithms. 

Used algorithms: deepmatching(from THOTH), deepflow (from THOTH)
See THOTH here: https://thoth.inrialpes.fr/src/deepflow/.

Docker was build based on the other dockerfile (https://github.com/saephir/thoth-ml), but few libraries were added (opencv, h5py).
